# Cancellation Policy

## Order Cancellation
You may cancel your order for a full refund if it has not yet been shipped. To cancel, please contact customer support immediately at support@example.com or call 1-800-555-0199.

## Shipped Orders
If your order has already been shipped, it cannot be cancelled. You will need to wait for the item to arrive and then follow our Return Policy to return it.

## Subscription Cancellations
- **Monthly Subscriptions**: You can cancel at any time. Your access will continue until the end of the current billing cycle.
- **Annual Subscriptions**: Cancellations for annual subscriptions must be made at least 30 days before the renewal date to avoid being charged for the next year. We do NOT provide prorated refunds for partial years.

## Service Appointments
For service-based appointments (e.g., consulting, installation), cancellations must be made at least 24 hours in advance. Cancellations made less than 24 hours before the appointment will incur a $50 cancellation fee.
