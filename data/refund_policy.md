# Refund Policy

## Overview
This Refund Policy outlines the conditions under which customers are entitled to a refund for products purchased from our company.

## Eligibility for Refund
- **Defective Products**: If the product is defective upon arrival, you are eligible for a full refund or replacement within 30 days of purchase.
- **Change of Mind**: We offer a refund for "change of mind" returns within 14 days of receipt, provided the item is unused, in its original packaging, and in resalable condition. A 10% restocking fee may apply.
- **Digital Products**: All sales of digital products (e.g., software, e-books) are final and non-refundable unless the content is proven to be defective or not as described.

## Refund Process
1. Contact our support team at support@example.com with your order number and reason for the return.
2. Once your return is approved, you will serve a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number.
3. Ship the item back to us at your expense (unless the item is defective).
4. Refunds will be processed within 5-7 business days after we receive the returned item.

## Non-Refundable Items
- Gift cards
- Personalized or custom-made items
- Perishable goods

## Late or Missing Refunds
If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again. Then contact your credit card company, as it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.
